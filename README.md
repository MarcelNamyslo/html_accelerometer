An accelerometer sensor measures constant (gravity), time varying (vibrations) and quasi static (tilt) acceleration forces, which affect the device on the three axes (x, y and z) in meter per second squared (m/s2)

This html page is a simple app to move a ball on your screen by rotating the phone along the two axes X and Y.
